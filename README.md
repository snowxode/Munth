A-LEVEL NEA (Non Examined Assesment)

This was a project for my NEA in my Computer Science A level course(2021).
We were tasked to find a client who had a project they wanted completed. 
My client was looking for a game developer to make a small indie game demo.

The PDF in the repository is the documentation of the production of the game.
